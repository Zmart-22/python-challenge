Module 3 Challenge
This was my first crack at attempting to do a Python challenge. I will admit I have a long way to go as this took me countless hours and tons of research on how I could correctly run some python loops. I am taking some additional python classes online at the same time to try to keep up as I have fallen behind. 
This activity has sure had my brains spinning starting with the PyBank challenge in which I was tasked with taking the given data and to do the following: 

The total number of months included in the dataset

The net total amount of "Profit/Losses" over the entire period

The changes in "Profit/Losses" over the entire period, and then the average of those changes

The greatest increase in profits (date and amount) over the entire period

The greatest decrease in profits (date and amount) over the entire period


At each step I was able to use the skills I have learned and hone them using many different options. I do believe there is no one correct way to code and everyones style is different. I did not use pandas as I know we will have a challenge with pandas upcoming. For this i used csv reader, jupyter notebook, terminal, and python itself.

Through my code I was able to extract the data and then run analysis on loops for certain information needed such as total months, total profit, profit change, and greatest increase and decrease.

For the poll challenge i was able to use my coding from the data and extract in loops the winning candidate and how many votes they received. 

I really need to improve on my python skills and catch up in the class as I know this is only going to get more challenging.

Practice practice practice is what I need to do but am confident I can continue to perform if I need to. This went way better than my VBA assignment.
